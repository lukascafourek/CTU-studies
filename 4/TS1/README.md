# Software Testing

## Structure of this repository

Codes from tutorials (labs) are named and numbered according to the number of the tutorial. Same applies for homework (hw) codes.

Exceptions:
- on some labs there was no programming or I was not present, therefore their numbers are not here.
- lab01_hw01 where the codes from the tutorial are same as required in the homework.
- hw03 was a test on Moodle so it is not here in the repository.
- hw05 is named as cv06-pairwise because of the homework instructions.
- hw06 is named as cv07-process because of the homework instructions.
- hw07 is named as ts1-selenium because of the homework instructions.
- lab10 contains Moodle robot test automatization.
